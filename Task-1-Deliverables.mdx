# Task 1 Deliverables

The first thing I had to learn was how to use Mintlify and connect it to Github. I was following the Mintlify Documentation resource when I realized that it was for creating an entirely new repo based off of the Mintlify sample template. So I uploaded the take-home assessment to my Github directly and then connected it to Mintlify, so I could edit the assessment directly in Mintlify.

## Decision-Making Process

In terms of refactoring the navigation structure in 'docs.json' to provide the best possible user experience while ensuring all content remains accessible, I first added all the documentation in the files directory to the navigation editor. In this process, I noticed that some of the 'v1' pages were missing, so I added those as well.

After that, I noticed that 'v1' was in a group and not using Mintlify's version navigation element. So I used two version navigation elements to organize the v1 and v2 files.

## Key User Experience Improvements

Since users usually want to read up on the most updated version of whatever they are looking into, I made v2 the default.

For language, since English is widely used across various countries, I decided to use that as the default language. This is also recommended according to Mintlify's documentation.

## Trade-Offs Considered

When I tried to add in the French translations, I ran into a cross-roads on how to structure the navigation menu. Would it be better to use the language navigation element as the high level parent or the product navigation element.

## Structure that Scales for Future Growth

I decided to use the product navigation element since I feel like it will scale better for a company's future growth. If the company decides to create a new product or tool, then they can easier add in another product navigation element and add documentation for it.

## Scenario

You're working with a developer tools company that has grown rapidly. They started with a basic documentation site but now need to evolve their structure to better serve their expanding user base. The company has:

- **Created a v2 of their API** with new advanced features
- **Expanded internationally** and needs French language support

Your task is to redesign the documentation navigation structure to create an intuitive, scalable user experience.

## Task 1: Navigation Structure & Information Architecture

**Primary Goal**: Refactor the navigation structure in `docs.json` to provide the best possible user experience while ensuring all content remains accessible.

**What you're working with**:

- `v1/` - Original English documentation
- `v2/` - Updated English documentation with new features
- `fr/` - French translations of both v1 and v2 content
