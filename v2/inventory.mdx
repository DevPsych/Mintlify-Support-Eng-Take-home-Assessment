# Inventory Management - v2.0

Track salsa ingredients with AI-powered predictions and real-time IoT sensor monitoring.

## Overview

Our v2.0 inventory management system uses artificial intelligence and IoT sensors to provide intelligent tracking, predictive ordering, and automated waste prevention.

## Key Features

<Card title="AI-Powered Tracking">
  Monitor your ingredient levels with intelligent predictions:

  - **Predictive stock levels**: AI forecasts when you'll run out
  - **Automated reordering**: Smart ordering based on usage patterns
  - **Usage predictions**: Machine learning predicts ingredient needs
  - **Anomaly detection**: AI identifies unusual consumption patterns

  ```javascript
  // Example: Get AI inventory predictions
  const predictions = await salsa.ai.inventory.predict({
    location: "kitchen_1",
    horizon_days: 7
  });

  console.log(`Predicted reorder date: ${predictions.reorder_date}`);
  ```
