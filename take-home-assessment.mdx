# Task 1 Deliverables

The first thing I had to learn was how to use Mintlify and connect it to Github. I was following the Mintlify Documentation resource when I realized that it was for creating an entirely new repo based off of the Mintlify sample template. So I uploaded the take-home assessment to my Github directly and then connected it to Mintlify, so I could edit the assessment directly in Mintlify.

## Decision-Making Process

In terms of refactoring the navigation structure in 'docs.json' to provide the best possible user experience while ensuring all content remains accessible, I first added all the documentation in the files directory to the navigation editor. In this process, I noticed that some of the 'v1' pages were missing, so I added those as well.

After that, I noticed that 'v1' was in a group and not using Mintlify's version navigation element. So I used two version navigation elements to organize the v1 and v2 files.

For grouping the pages, I looked up popular documentation sites that use Mintlify like Stripe, Coinbase, and Perplexity to use as references on how to group pages. I noticed that most have an intro in the beginning that includes getting started quickly and pricing. Then it naturally progresses into integrations and features. Lastly, there is a section for developers to reference.

## Key User Experience Improvements

Since users usually want to read up on the most updated version of whatever they are looking into, I made v2 the default.

For language, since English is widely used across various countries, I decided to use that as the default language. This is also recommended according to Mintlify's documentation.

I also grouped the pages so that users can go through the pages naturally. They get an overview of the app, then move onto specific features the app provides, and then learn how to use the app.

## Trade-Offs Considered

When I tried to add in the French translations, I ran into a cross-roads on how to structure the navigation menu. Would it be better to use the language navigation element as a higher level parent or the product navigation element?

I also looked into how to organize the pages a lot. I thought about whether I should cater to first time users or developers first. It seems more natural to cater to first time users and have resources for developers to reference later.

## Structure that Scales for Future Growth

I decided to use the product navigation element since I felt like it would scale better for a company's future growth. If the company decides to create a new product or tool, then they can easier add in another product navigation element and add documentation for it. Then within that product, they can add in languages as documentation is translated.

# Task 2 Deliverables

## Callouts

I saw that the original pages tried to highlight warnings, tips, and notes with bold letters, but I think Callouts make such info standout much better. The different colors and icons help users read through the documentation faster and catch important info easier.

## Cards

I liked how Preplexity used Cards at the end of their pages to link to other pages. Since there were a few pages with contact information or redirects to get help, I decided to use cards for them as well.

## Steps

I added steps to the Getting Started and Advanced Usage pages where the user had to follow a sequence of steps to do something. This will help differentiate numbered bullet points from instructions that require steps to follow.

## Update

I changed the original changelog page so that it uses Update. As long as future devs continue to use Update, then the format should stay consistent. It also automatically creates RSS entries.
